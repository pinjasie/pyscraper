This Python web scraper script utilizes _urllib_ and _BeautifulSoup_ modules for web scraping and parsing data. The script opens a CSV file, defines its headers and writes the details of each company on the processed pages as rows.

The script makes HTTP requests, scrapes company information from the pages and saves them to the CSV-formatted file. Additionally the script prints a message after processing each page.

The objective for scraping data is to retrieve contact information (name and address of the company and a link to the website) of ICT businesses listed in the www.finder.fi website. The reason behind scraping specifically ICT businesses data is to assist my students at Keuda vocational school in more effective search of internship opportunities.
